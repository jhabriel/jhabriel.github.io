# Hi there, I'm Jhabriel 👋

### Assistant Professor at Polytechnic University Taiwan-Paraguay 🇵🇾🇹🇼

I am a researcher bridging the gap between applied mathematics and computational engineering. My work focuses on **numerical analysis**, **mathematical modeling of transport processes in porous media**, and **open-source scientific software**.

---

### 🔭 Current Research & Development
I am currently focused on three core areas:
1.  **Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR):** Guided by *a posteriori* error analysis to optimize computational resources.
2.  **Fractured Porous Media:** Modeling flow and transport in complex fracture networks.
3.  **KrySBAS Toolbox:** Developing the *Krylov Subspace-Based Adaptive Solvers* for MATLAB/OCTAVE.

### 🛠 Languages & Methods
* **Languages:** MATLAB, Python, C++, LaTeX
* **Methods:** Finite Element Method (FEM), Finite Volume Method (FVM), Finite Differences, Mimetic Finite Differences, Krylov Subspace Methods
* **Tools:** Git, Overleaf, IPE
